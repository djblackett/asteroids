# Asteroids

This began as an exercise in U of Helsinki's Advanced Course in Programming (https://programming-23.mooc.fi/)  
The course provided all the visual assets.  
I added some chiptune background music I wrote a few years ago and some sound effects to make it more engaging.

## How to Run

If you have pygame installed, just run main.py, and it should work. If you are running it in an IDE such as VSCode, it might be expecting there to be a `src/` before the filename in the relative path. In this case, change the `src` variable at the top of `main.py` to equal `"src/"`

## Gameplay

Catch all of the asteroids before they touch the ground. Use the left and right arrow keys to move the robot. Good luck!
